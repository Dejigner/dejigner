**Neuromorphic Photonics | AI Acceleration & Edge Intelligence**  
Electronics & Communication Engineering @ Ain Shams University

---

I build things at the intersection of hardware and intelligence—where neural networks meet microcontrollers, and AI models run on constrained systems because not everything needs a GPU farm.

Currently exploring **neuromorphic photonics** (because silicon has its limits) and working on making AI accessible to the next generation through **LearnSpace**, the educational org I founded. I'm fascinated by the challenge of deploying intelligence at the edge: lightweight models, efficient architectures, and systems that work in the real world—not just on benchmark datasets.

## What I'm Working On

**🔬 Research Interest:** Neuromorphic computing, AI acceleration, and bridging the gap between secure algorithms and hardware implementation

**🏗️ Current Focus:**
- Optimizing inference for resource-constrained environments (TinyLlama deployment, model compression)
- Deep learning competitions with STP (PyTorch/TensorFlow, custom architectures)
- Teaching AI fundamentals to 40+ students through hands-on projects

**🛠️ Recent Build:** PDF-based RAG chatbot using Sentence Transformers + FAISS + TinyLlama (1.1B params) for local, hallucination-resistant Q&A from curriculum materials

## Tech Philosophy

I believe the future of AI isn't just bigger models—it's smarter deployment. My background spans:
- **Embedded Systems**: Cortex-M4, AUTOSAR, RTOS, automotive protocols (I2C, SPI, UART, CAN)
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, computer vision, model optimization
- **Hardware Security**: HSM, automotive cybersecurity (because intelligent systems need to be robust)

This combination lets me think about AI not just as software, but as systems that need to exist in power-constrained, security-critical, real-time environments.

## Selected Projects

**PDF RAG Chatbot** (2024-2025)  
Retrieval-augmented generation system using Sentence Transformers for embeddings, FAISS for vector search, and TinyLlama for local inference. Built to extract context-grounded answers from curriculum PDFs while addressing LLM hallucination through grounded retrieval.

**Industrial Air-Conditioned Safety Helmet** (2024)  
Thermoelectric cooling system for worker safety. Circuit design, heat transfer calculations, and TEC optimization—solving a real problem with electronics fundamentals.

**YOLO Object Detection Pipeline** (2025)  
600-image dataset, 100 epochs, end-to-end training and evaluation. Focused on understanding the full pipeline, not just using pre-trained weights.

**Genetic Algorithm Maze Solver** (2024)  
Comparative implementation of BFS, DFS, A*, and genetic algorithms with Tkinter visualization. Built for ITI's final project—because sometimes brute force isn't the answer.

## Recognition

🥉 **3rd Place** - Microsoft ML Projects (MCIT x EYouth) across the Data Science Track  
🥇 **Regional Champion** - Gold Medalist (competition details in profile)  
📚 **GPA:** 3.7+/4.0 | Class Representative for Electronics & Communication Engineering

## Beyond Code

**Founder & Lead Educator @ LearnSpace** - Making AI and emerging tech accessible to youth through hands-on learning (currently running programs at British International School of Cairo)

**Former AI Trainer @ AUC** - Taught AI applications across marketing, design, cybersecurity, and digital influence to summer camp students

## Let's Connect

I'm interested in opportunities in **AI acceleration**, **MLOps**, **edge AI**, and **neuromorphic computing**—anywhere intelligent systems meet hardware constraints.
